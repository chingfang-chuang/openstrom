Smat meter test programs for Ethernet,WiFi and Zigbee modules 


1. For Ehernet module

	Ethernet module is built on the Microchip PIC32MXF0512H and Microchip PHY LAN8720A




2. For WiFi module 

	WiFi module is realized by Espressif ESP-WROOM-2this module is connected to the PIc32MXF0512H by UART RS-232 interface

	The test prorams that are developed at the moment are:

	- SM-wifi-sta-tcp-client for the mode STATION;

	- SM-wifi-ap-tcp-client fot the mode ACCESS POINT;

All these source files can be find in the dropbox folder Wifi_Test_Ppograms

As a basic IDE is use Eclipse. As a approuch how to create Wifi applications program can be find in the link

3. Zigbee Module 

	ZigBee is a Microchip MFR24J40MA. This module is conneccted to the main microcontroller PIc32mxF0512H by the SDI interface
	The basic sources for futher development can be find in the Dropbox folder - Zigbee Application programs
